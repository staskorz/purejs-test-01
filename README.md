# purejs-test-01

This project was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) with `--use-npm` flag to match the requirements.
React was then removed cause it's a PureJS project. I've used create-react-app in order not to waste time on project setup.

## Usage

Install dependencies:<br/>
`npm install`

Run:<br/>
`npm start`
